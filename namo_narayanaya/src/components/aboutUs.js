          Gunaseela Mahatmiyam
A disciple of Talbiya Maharishi, Gunaseelar learned the Vedas and Puranas well by working for Guru Nath in an ashram located in the forest called Nilivanam (now known as Tiruppainjreeli). Once Talpiyar went to the Himalayas with his disciples and worshiped Vyasa, then bathed in the Ganges and other holy rivers and on his way back to his ashram went to Tiruvenkatamalai where he stood there with great amazement to worship Tiruvenkatamudayana. Maharishi Gunaseela, not wanting to leave him, asked him to come back to his ashram. But Thiruvenkatamudaya, till the end of this kalpa, since you have received blessings from Tirumala, if you go to your ashram and do penance, ask your gurunath and find out the method for this.
            Talbeer also revealed a strategy to convey the order of Emperuma to his Gurunath. Everything that is going to happen in Purana is told. As a result of your penance, Sri Vaikundavasudevan will come to your ashram on the north bank of Cauvery along with Sridevi. With the name of Sri Prasanna Venkatesan, till the end of this kalpa, stand up as Divyamangala Vigraha Svarupanai. The devotee completes the Bhishtha and goes to Nityavasam. So he blessed you to go to your ashram and do penance.
Gunaseela Maharishi arrived at his ashram on the banks of the Kaveri with great joy and the blessing of Gurunath Talpiyar, who was about to fulfill his wish.
There they bathed in the river Kaveri and meditated on Sri Vaikunda Vasudevan and performed penance. He performed austere penance in the middle of panchagni in summer, in wet clothes in winter and standing in water during rainy season. Seeing his penance, the gods were afraid. Thinking that his position would be in danger, Indra tried to destroy Gunaseela's penance with thunder, rain, wind, lightning and many other ways. But these could not dissolve Gunaseela's penance. Devas like Indra bowed down to Brahma to know about Kunaseela's penance. Brahma knows through his knowledge and penances on Gunaseela Vaikunda Vasudeva. He goes to his ashram and performs penance with great joy, with the prayer that he may live eternally. Therefore, you have nothing to do with him, so don't be afraid, said Brahma. Hearing this, Indradhi Devas bowed down to Brahma and took leave.
At Sri Vaikunda, situated beyond the vastness of the Viraja River, with billions of sun-lit airfields and gem-encrusted pillars, Sridevi, Bhuthevisamamedharai, seated on the Adisashan praised by Sanakati sages, Narada and sages, Lord Sri Vaikunda Vasudevan appeared to Gunaseela Maharishi, who was penitent, with Sridevi. Arohanindu Vaikuntha ascended with the beautiful Garu Beyond Virajanidhi, he got up to Kunaseela's ashram situated on the beautiful banks of Kaveri river, looking at Mahameruparvat, Himalayas, Vindhyamalai, etc.

Knowing in advance of Lord Brahma's arrival, together with Brahma Saraswati as Hamzarudar and Shiva Parvati as Rishabarudra, Indradevi Devas, Sanagati Munivaras, Narada Thumburu, Gandharvas, Kinnars Kimpurushas, Yakshas, Sakyas, Saranas etc. were assembled in Gunasilarasram along with Talpiar and his disciples.
Knowing that Vaikunda Vasudevan had risen to his ashram along with Sridevi, Gunaseela also came out of penance and saw Sri Vaikunda Vasudevan, who appeared like a bull cloud above Mahameru with the brightness of the sun, and bowed down on his back.</p>
